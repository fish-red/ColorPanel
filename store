It's time, once and for all, to stop messing around with custom little color pickers. OS X ships with one of the finest color pickers in all the land, complete with plugin support. The only thing to do is load it up as a separate application, that's where ColorPanel comes in...

ColorPanel cleanly wraps Apple's default NSColorPanel picker with a minimalist app to harness the power without any bloat or extraneous features. ColorPanel offers a high customizability using Cocoa's built-in advanced features. Control the floating vs regular mode of the color picker, as well as the standard size to use for the window. This is a pro tool in a simple light weight app.

Features:
- Use Apple's builtin color picker as a stand alone app
- Control all aspects of the experience with advanced settings
- Set window floating on startup
- Toggle window floating
- Set specified window size on startup
- With many more features coming soon ...

Supports:
- All NSColorPanel plugins (including outgoing network access)
